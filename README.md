# Chat Application using React

Introduction: 
This is a Microsoft Teams like application built with React JS and Chat Engine where everyone has a different login credentials and can chat with the specific person.

You can search for people or even can create groups.

Currently this doesn't support Video Call/ Call feature. It's just a messaging application using React.
